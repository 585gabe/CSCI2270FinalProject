# CSCI2270FinalProject
Nicolaus Wolfrum & Elliot Benson's CSCI 2270 Final Project

Project Summary: Our project was to write a program for a "Go Fish" game. Using an assortment of data structures and other C++ methods that we learned over the course of the semseter, our program reads in a pre-created file with a standard deck of cards excluding jokers. The program then "shuffles" the cards using an array shuffling algorithm, and "deals" seven cards to each player (The game is played as one player vs. the computer. Time permitting we may be able to make a player vs player option) After the cards are dealt, the game is played like standard "Go Fish", where each player takes turns attempting to get four cards of the same number (ex. four "aces"). The program searches the other players cards for the desired card number and returns the cards if found to the first player. If not found, the second player says "Go Fish", and the first player draws a card from the pool. The game is played until the pool is empty, and at the end the score is totalled based on who has the most sets of four. The program will use an assortment of arrays, linked lists, vectors, and structs to achieve this.
